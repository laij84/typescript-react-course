# Let's Build a Shopping Basket inn React with TypeScript!

## About the course

The aim of this course is to help developers coming from React JS and class components to start thinking in TypeScript and React Hooks.

This course will use the core principles of persistent storage - `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` (CRUD) - to build a shopping basket in React, where you can add items (create), view your basket (read), edit quantities (update) and remove items from the basket (delete).

## Outcomes

By the end of the course you should be familiar with:

-   Using TypeScript instead of PropTypes when typing your React components
-   Debugging TypeScript and inspecting existing type definitions from libraries like React.
-   Using React Functional Components with React Hooks to manage state and simple "lifecycle" operations (e.g when mounting, when updating).
-   Redux-pattern state management with the useReducer hook.
-   A basic understanding of GraphQL and Apollo JS.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and run `yarn` in the project root to install dependencies.

The repository contains a folder for each lesson. The starter code for each subsequent lesson should be the finishing code for the previous lesson.

To run a lesson, make sure you have an `.env` file in the root of your project. Update the .env variable `REACT_APP_LESSON` to the number of the lesson you want to run. For example, to run lesson 1, your `.env` file should contain `REACT_APP_LESSON=1`.

After you have selected the lesson, run `yarn start` to run the application in your browser.

Each lesson has an accompanying README. Read it IN FULL first before attempting anything, then refer to it throughout the lesson.

The ending code for each lesson is the starter code for the next. Try and not look ahead, but use it as a reference if needed.
