# Introduction to TypeScript in React

## About the course

The aim of this course is to help developers coming from ReactJS learn basic TypeScript, specifically how to use it when building a React application. We will be focusing on modern React syntax using Function Components and Hooks.

Learn by doing - this course will use the core principles of persistent storage - `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` (CRUD) - to build a Todo App in React with TypeScript.

## Outcomes

By the end of the course you should be familiar with:

- Typescript basics (string, number, boolean, Array, tuple, enum, object, any, null, undefined and never)
- Some advanced types (unions, interfaces, generics)
- Using TypeScript instead of PropTypes when typing your React component props.
- Debugging TypeScript and inspecting existing type definitions from third party libraries like React.
- Using Typescript with Function Components and Hooks

## Getting started

Clone the repository and run `yarn` in the project root to install dependencies.

The repository contains a folder for each lesson. The starter code for each subsequent lesson should be the finishing code for the previous lesson.

Lesson 0 contains a README.md file which is an introduction to TypeScript and should be read in full before starting Lesson 1.

To run a lesson, make sure you have an `.env` file in the root of your project. Update the .env variable `REACT_APP_LESSON` to the number of the lesson you want to run. For example, to run lesson 1, your `.env` file should contain `REACT_APP_LESSON=1`.

After you have selected the lesson, run `yarn start` to run the application in your browser.

Each lesson has an accompanying README. Read it IN FULL first before attempting anything, then refer to it throughout the lesson.

The ending code for each lesson is the starter code for the next. Try and not look ahead, but use it as a reference if needed.
